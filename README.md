# gulp_project_v2

## Project 8 for Trehouse FSJS Techdegree

### Complete Rebuild of gulp build pipeline project because dependencies had too many breaking changes :(

* Aiming for exceeds

* Project uses inline source maps for CSS and JavaScript

* Please note, I felt to be more like a real world project the final index.html file should be in the dist folder, too, so please use that one when checking to see if everything worked. Thank you!

* This project uses `gulp` v4 and requires that `gulp-cli` be installed globally to be able to run the `gulp` command from the root directory. The project was designed using `gulp-cli` v2

* Available `gulp` commands:

  * `gulp clean`

  * `gulp-images`

  * `gulp styles`

  * `gulp scripts`

  * `gulp serve`

  * `gulp build`

  * `gulp` default command
